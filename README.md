Requires Python 3.7.

Create a program that manages a list of books that the user wishes to read, and books that the user has read.

The program should be able to add a new book to the list, search for a book from the list, show unread books and read books,show all books, and also change book read status.

The program crashes if user tries to modify read/unread for a book that is not in the bookstore. Use Exception Handling and display a message when a user tries to modify read/unread for a book that is not in the bookstore. Also prevent duplicate books added to the bookstore.
Finally, add a blank line before and after a list of books.
